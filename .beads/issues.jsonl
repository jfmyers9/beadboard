The two tools are\none-directional: Claude writes beads, neovim reads them.\n\nMeanwhile, Claude Code skills already accept bare bead IDs as\narguments (/explore, /implement, /prepare, /review, /debug,\n/start, /respond). The `claude` CLI supports -p (print mode)\nand interactive terminal sessions. Neovim can shell out via\nvim.system() or open terminal buffers via nvim_open_term().\n\n**Key constraint**: Running inside a Claude terminal sets\nCLAUDECODE env var, blocking nested invocations. Solvable by\nunsetting it in vim.system() calls.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAdd a `claude.lua` module to beadboard.nvim that bridges bead\ncontext to the `claude` CLI. Two interaction levels:\n\n1. **Keybinding dispatch** — from detail or list view, press\n   `gC` to open a skill picker, then launch the skill in a\n   terminal buffer with the current bead ID\n2. **Command dispatch** — `:BdClaude \u003cskill\u003e [id]` for\n   scripting and direct invocation\n\nTerminal buffer mode (interactive) for most skills; print mode\nfor fire-and-forget ops. No changes needed to skills or bd CLI\n— purely additive in the neovim plugin.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Core claude.lua module**\n1. Create lua/beadboard/claude.lua with run(skill, bead_id, opts)\n2. Handle CLAUDECODE env var unset in vim.system() calls\n3. Support terminal mode (nvim_open_term) and print mode\n4. Error handling: claude not on PATH, exit codes\n\n**Phase 2: Detail/list view keybindings**\n5. Add gC keymap in detail + list views → skill picker\n6. Filter skill list by bead context (title prefix, field presence)\n7. On selection, open terminal split with claude session\n\n**Phase 3: Quick-create-and-dispatch**\n8. :BdQuickExplore \u003ctopic\u003e — create bead + invoke /explore\n9. :BdQuickFix — prompt for feedback + invoke /fix\n10. Compose create wizard with skill dispatch\n\n**Phase 4: Terminal buffer management**\n11. Track active Claude terminals per bead ID (no duplicates)\n12. Keybinding to jump to active Claude session for a bead\n13. TermClose autocmd → auto-refresh bead view on exit\n\n**Phase 5: Configuration and skill discovery**\n14. claude_cmd, claude_default_mode, claude_model config opts\n15. Dynamic skill discovery: scan ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md\n16. Future-proof skill picker as new skills are added\n\n**Phase 6: Bidirectional sync**\n17. On Claude terminal close, refresh all beadboard buffers\n18. BufEnter autocmd: lightweight refresh if bead recently modified\n19.

No two skills ever share a\nbead's notes field. The \"conflict\" concern is theoretical, not real.\n\n## Recommendation (Updated)\n\n**Use notes as the long-form feedback channel, inline args as\nthe quick shortcut.**\n\n### Why notes wins over comments:\n- \\`en\\` in TUI opens full markdown buffer — natural for paragraphs\n- User can revise before saving (comments are append-only)\n- Notes rendered in detail view alongside design — easy to review\n- Comments TUI input is single-line only — terrible for long-form\n- No actual conflict risk since skills partition beads by title\n\n### Two input paths:\n1. **Long-form**: \\`bd edit \u003cid\u003e --notes\\` (or \\`en\\` in TUI), then\n   \\`/explore \u003cid\u003e\\`\n2. **Quick**: \\`/explore \u003cid\u003e focus on error handling\\` (inline args\n   take precedence over notes)\n\n### Behavior:\n- Notes non-empty → use as continuation direction\n- Inline args present → use those (override notes)\n- Neither → generic \"deepen the exploration\" continuation\n- Notes are NOT cleared after reading — user manages their own\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Skill reads notes as continuation direction**\n1. In Continue Exploration flow, extract notes field from\n   \\`bd show \u003cid\u003e --json\\`\n2. If notes non-empty, use as \\`\u003cnew-instructions\u003e\\` in subagent prompt\n3. If notes empty, fall back to generic continuation\n\n**Phase 2: Inline args as quick shortcut**\n4. Parse \\`\\$ARGUMENTS\\` after bead ID for inline text\n5. Inline text takes precedence over notes field\n6. Two paths: \\`en\\` in TUI for long-form, inline for one-liners\n\n**Phase 3: Update output format**\n7. Change \\`**Next**\\` line to show notes workflow:\n   \"To guide next round: \\`bd edit \u003cid\u003e --notes\\`, then\n   \\`/explore \u003cid\u003e\\`\"\n8. Also show inline shortcut syntax\n\n**Phase 4: TUI affordance**\n9. In \\`pick_and_run\\`, when skill is explore on an Explore: bead,\n   prompt \"Edit notes to guide exploration? (y/n)\" before dispatch\n10. If yes, open notes editor, then dispatch after save\n\n**Phase 5: Apply pattern to /review**\n11. Same notes-as-direction pattern for review continuation\n12.

PreToolUse hooks would be valuable as\na future enhancement for users who want fine-grained control\n(e.g., auto-allow bd commands but prompt for other Bash usage).\nCould be offered as an optional \"strict mode\" configuration.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"Jim Myers","owner":"jim.myers@jfmyers.dev","created_at":"2026-02-12T23:44:01.087872-08:00","created_by":"Jim Myers","updated_at":"2026-02-12T23:52:13.867045-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T23:52:13.867045-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"beadboard-o3r.7","depends_on_id":"beadboard-o3r","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-12T23:44:01.088846-08:00","created_by":"Jim Myers"},{"issue_id":"beadboard-o3r.7","depends_on_id":"beadboard-o3r.6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-12T23:44:15.608697-08:00","created_by":"Jim Myers"}]}

Fuzzy picker for target issue selection\n\n**Phase 3: Dynamic pickers and filter enhancements**\n8. Replace hardcoded type list with bd types --json throughout\n9. Label picker from bd label list-all --json\n10. Date-range filter support in filter.lua\n11. --all toggle for closed issues in list\n12. --label-any and --empty-description filter options\n\n**Phase 4: Triage workflows**\n13. defer/undefer keymaps (gD/gU) in list and detail buffers\n14. :BdStale command with configurable --days\n15. :BdEpicStatus command\n16.

Parent assignment/change via picker\n\n**Phase 5: Dependency graph view**\n18. graph.lua module rendering bd graph output in buffer\n19. gg keymap in detail buffer for current issue graph\n20. :BdGraph command\n21.

Fuzzy issue picker module (vim.ui.select or telescope.nvim)\n24.
