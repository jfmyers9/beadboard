{"id":"beadboard-rgg","title":"Explore: Missing bd functionality for beadboard.nvim","description":"## Acceptance Criteria\n- Findings stored in bead design field (not filesystem)\n- Structured as Current State, Recommendation, and phased Next Steps\n- Each phase is independently actionable","design":"## 1. Current State\n\n### bd CLI surface area\n\n**Core CRUD:** create (full fields), update (any field), show (--refs/--thread/--children), close, reopen, delete, list (extensive filtering), search, query, comments, edit\n\n**Dependencies \u0026 Structure:** dep add/remove/list/tree/cycles/relate/unrelate, children, graph (box/compact), duplicate/supersede, epic status/close-eligible\n\n**Triage \u0026 Workflow:** ready, blocked, stale, defer/undefer, promote, rename, todo add/done/list, set-state/state, move/refile\n\n**Views \u0026 Reports:** status, count (by-status/priority/type/assignee/label), activity (--follow), types, find-duplicates, duplicates, lint, label list-all\n\n### Plugin currently implements\n\n**Commands (6):** :Beadboard, :BdSearch, :BdQuery, :BdReady, :BdBlocked, :BdStatus\n\n**List keymaps (17):** open detail, refresh, close, status cycle/pick, priority cycle, close, reopen, claim, create (title-only), delete, filter, clear filters, sort, search, query, help\n\n**Detail keymaps (20):** close, refresh, status/priority cycle, close, reopen, claim, assignee, label add/remove, comment, edit desc/design/notes/acceptance/title, show deps, go parent, show children, help\n\n**Create flow:** Title-only via vim.ui.input — no type/priority/description/parent/labels/assignee\n\n### Gaps\n\n**High-value (daily workflow):**\n1. Rich create form (type, priority, description, assignee, labels, parent, due, estimate)\n2. Dependency mutation (dep add/remove/relate/unrelate) — currently read-only\n3. Dependency graph view\n4. Type change keymap\n5. Due date / estimate editing\n6. Defer / undefer\n7. Stale issues view\n8. List filter gaps (date ranges, --label-any, --label-pattern, --all, --desc-contains, --empty-description, --no-assignee, --no-labels)\n9. Parent assignment/change\n10. Label autocomplete from bd label list-all\n11. Dynamic type list from bd types --json\n12. Epic status\n\n**Medium-value (occasional):**\n13. Rename\n14. Duplicate / supersede\n15. Promote (wisp to permanent)\n16. Count by assignee/label in dashboard\n17. TODO shortcuts\n18. Activity feed\n19. Bulk operations (multi-select close/delete/defer)\n20. Telescope/fzf integration for issue picker\n\n## 2. Recommendation\n\nPrioritize by user friction — features that force dropping to terminal.\nCreate form is the biggest gap (every new issue needs terminal update).\nDependency mutation is second (core beads differentiator, read-only now).\nThen dynamic pickers, triage workflows, graph view, bulk ops, remaining.\n\n## 3. Next Steps\n\n**Phase 1: Rich issue creation**\n1. Multi-field create flow covering: title, type, priority, description, assignee, labels, parent\n2. Fetch types from bd types --json, labels from bd label list-all --json for pickers\n3. Wire C in list buffer to new create flow\n4. Add :BdCreate user command\n\n**Phase 2: Dependency management**\n5. Detail keymaps: da (dep add), dr (dep remove), dR (dep relate), dU (dep unrelate)\n6. db shorthand for dep add --blocks\n7. Fuzzy picker for target issue selection\n\n**Phase 3: Dynamic pickers and filter enhancements**\n8. Replace hardcoded type list with bd types --json throughout\n9. Label picker from bd label list-all --json\n10. Date-range filter support in filter.lua\n11. --all toggle for closed issues in list\n12. --label-any and --empty-description filter options\n\n**Phase 4: Triage workflows**\n13. defer/undefer keymaps (gD/gU) in list and detail buffers\n14. :BdStale command with configurable --days\n15. :BdEpicStatus command\n16. Due date and estimate editing in detail buffer\n17. Parent assignment/change via picker\n\n**Phase 5: Dependency graph view**\n18. graph.lua module rendering bd graph output in buffer\n19. gg keymap in detail buffer for current issue graph\n20. :BdGraph command\n21. Navigation within graph (CR on issue ID opens detail)\n\n**Phase 6: Bulk operations and fuzzy picker**\n22. Visual-mode selection in list for bulk close/delete/defer/update\n23. Fuzzy issue picker module (vim.ui.select or telescope.nvim)\n24. Wire picker into dep-add, parent-set, duplicate-of, supersede-with\n\n**Phase 7: Activity feed and remaining**\n25. :BdActivity command with optional auto-refresh\n26. Rename action in detail buffer\n27. duplicate --of and supersede --with actions\n28. promote action for ephemeral issues\n29.
